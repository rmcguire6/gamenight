Chingu Solo Project - Tier 3 - Chingu Game Night

# Overview

This project is your chance to show off your backend skills as you prepare to start a Chingu voyage. This project requires yout to make a text based choose-your-own-adventure type game.

For this project you're just creating a simple text-based story line with multiple choices that the user can pick.

# About Chingu

In case you don't know, [Chingu](https://Chingu.io) takes you out of tutorial hell, puts you with a group of teammates to build a team project in 6 weeks using Agile methodology, and helps you develop the skills that employers are looking for. This solo project is the means we use to help you choose the right tier so that you enjoy your team project and are able both to learn new things and contribute.

# Tech Stacks and Resources

You can use any tech stack you choose. Frameworks and libraries are allowed.

Since this is a Tier 3 project you do need to have a database and persist data between sessions.

# Functionality

Pages:

- A home page, or start screen
- A minimum of 5 different places, other than the start screen, that the user can navigate to.
- At least 3 separate ways through the adventure from the home page to at least two different endings.
- Every page must be responsive and fit on a mobile sized screen as as well as a desktop.

# User Stories

- [ ] On loading the user sees a homepage/start screen which gives the directions for navigating and an introduction to the adventure.
- [ ] Each page needs to give the user at least two choices.
- [ ] User must be able to win or lose.
- [ ] Routing between pages must be done in the back end
- [ ] User must be able to save the adventure at any page and be able to resume there when they reload the game with the same game state.

## Suggestions

- Suggest that you map out your choices before you start coding. A plain piece of paper with a labeled map works out well although anything that helps you visualize your routes will work.
